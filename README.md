## 👋 About Me
Hey there! I'm passionate about **technology, security, and automation**. My journey started with a curiosity for **how systems work and how they can be protected**, which naturally led me into **cybersecurity**. Over time, I’ve expanded my skills into **security engineering, cloud security, infrastructure as code, and AI-driven security solutions**. This portfolio is a showcase of my diverse projects, skills, and experiences!

## 🎯 Objective
My goal is to become a **Security Engineer**, focusing on building **secure systems, implementing robust security measures, and integrating security at every level of development and deployment**. I specialize in **security automation, cloud security, threat detection, and infrastructure hardening**. Additionally, I am currently working on an **Honors Project on Cyber Attack Detection using Machine Learning in FinTech**, exploring the intersection of AI and cybersecurity to improve threat detection.
