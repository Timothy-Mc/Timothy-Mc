## 👋 About Me
Hey there! I'm passionate about **technology, security, and automation**. My journey started with a curiosity for **how systems work and how they can be protected**, which naturally led me into **cybersecurity**. Over time, I’ve expanded my skills into **DevSecOps, cloud security, and infrastructure as code**. This portfolio is a showcase of my diverse projects, skills, and experiences!

---

## 🎯 Objective
My goal is to become a **DevSecOps Engineer**, integrating security at every stage of the development lifecycle. I’m focused on **automating security, securing CI/CD pipelines, and implementing cloud-native security solutions** to bridge the gap between development, security, and operations.
