## About Me
Hi! I'm passionate about **technology, cybersecurity, and automation**. I started by exploring **how systems work and how to protect them**, which led me into cybersecurity. Over time, I’ve developed skills in **security engineering, cloud security, infrastructure as code, and AI-driven security solutions**.  

I enjoy tackling complex problems, building secure systems, and leveraging AI to make security smarter and more efficient.

---

## Objective
I am working towards becoming a **Security Engineer**, focusing on **building secure systems, implementing security measures, and integrating security at every stage of development and deployment**.  

Currently, I am developing my **Honors Project on Cyber Attack Detection using Machine Learning in FinTech**, exploring how AI can enhance threat detection in financial systems.

---

## Projects
Here are some of my key projects:

- **[Cyber Attack Detection in FinTech](#)** – Honors project using machine learning to detect attacks in financial environments.  
- **[Biometric Authentication System Using Face Recognition](#)** – Python-based authentication system leveraging facial recognition.  
- **[HybridIDPS](https://github.com/TheTheoM/HybridIDPS)** – Proof-of-concept hybrid intrusion detection and prevention system.  
- **[Network Scanner](#)** – Python-based network scanning tool.
